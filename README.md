# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction & Operational Optimization

**Logistic Regression, Bayesian Modeling, and Data-Driven Insights on U.S. Airline Delays (1990–1999)**

This project analyzes over a decade of U.S. domestic flight data to identify key factors contributing to delays and to develop a predictive logistic regression model. It combines classic machine learning, probabilistic sampling techniques, and statistical diagnostics to generate actionable insights for airline operations and scheduling optimization.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze U.S. flight delay data (1990–1999) to uncover factors contributing to delays.
- Build a robust **logistic regression** model to predict flight diversions.
- Generate operational insights (e.g. optimal departure time/day) to minimize delays.
- Apply advanced **Bayesian sampling** (Metropolis-Hastings, Gelman-Rubin diagnostics) to evaluate model convergence and reliability.

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- Cleaned and merged flight and aircraft metadata (50,000+ records).
- Engineered domain-specific features like **aircraft age** and **scheduled time segments**.
- Trained a logistic regression model, achieving up to **78% classification accuracy**.
- Conducted trend analysis of model coefficients over time for interpretability.
- Used **MCMC diagnostics** to validate parameter stability and model convergence.
- Created visual summaries to explain delay patterns by time, airline, and aircraft characteristics.
